Clone and start using UiOcat with JupyterLab. Preferably with
[Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html).

__GCAnalysisDashboard__ - Dashboard for analyzing GC data from the Cofeed and HighPressure rigs. <br><br>

__ReactorSetup__ - Dashboard/Calculator for setting up a catalytic reaction with various liquids
               as reactant. Uses the Antoine Eqs. to calculate reactant partial pressures. 
               Gives _weight hourly space velocity_ as well as reactant partial pressure as a
               function of temperature.
